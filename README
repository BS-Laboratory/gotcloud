To test the GotCloud aligner, run:

  bin/gen_biopipeline.pl --test ~/testalign

  This will create/clear the output directory ~/testalign.
  Test results and a log file are put in this directory.
  Results are self-checked and if errors should occur, it will be obvious.


To test the GotCloud umake, run:

  bin/umake.pl --test ~/testumake

  This will create/clear the output directory ~/testumake.
  Test results and a log file are put in this directory.
  Results are self-checked and if errors should occur, it will be obvious.



General Help for UMAKE:

UMAKE requires three types of input files:
  (1) a set of BAM files
      For high quality SNP calls BAM files should already be:
      * duplicate-marked 
      * base-quality recalibrated
  (2) index file
      Each line contains at least 3 space-separated columns representing a single individual:
      [SAMPLE_ID] [COMMA SEPARATED POPULATION LABELS] [BAM_FILE1] [BAM_FILE2] ...
      1 or more BAMs are allowed per individual
  (3) configuration file
      Contains run-time options & command line arguments.  
      A default configuration is provided.
      User must specify:
      * CHR = #space separated list of chromosomes
      * BAM_INDEX =   # the path/name of the index file
      Refer to the default configuration for more information on other settings.

      Optional specifications...
      * INPUT_ROOT
      * OUT_DIR

Optional input files:
   * Pedigree files (PED format) (to specify gender information in chrX calling)
   * Target information (UCSC's BED format) in targeted or whole exome capture sequencing

Once these files are configured, to run umake and process the data:
   {path}/umake/bin/umake.pl --conf {conf_file} --snpcall \
      --outdir {output_directory} --numJobs {# of threads to use for processing}
