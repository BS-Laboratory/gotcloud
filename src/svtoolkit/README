SVToolkit / Genome STRiP

SVToolkit and Genome STRiP (Genome STRucture In Populations) is a suite of tools for discovery and genotyping of structural variation using sequencing data.

The official website for SVToolkit / Genome STRiP is http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomestrip.
Documentation for SVToolkit / Genome STRiP is online at http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomestrip/documentation.

GenomeSTRiP was developed at the Broad Institute and at the McCarroll Lab at the Harvard Medical School Department of Genetics.
